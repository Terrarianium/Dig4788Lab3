Unity Script for 2D controller and rotating objects.
Player can move Up/Down/Left/Right
Enemies will orbit the player with the speed scaling exponentially based on distance to the player.
If an enemy is too far away it will come closer, if it is too close it will be pushed back.
The enemies also constantly turn to look at the player.
